Introduction
------------

Modern solar physics uses a large amount of high resolution ground- and space-based telescopes
to observe the Sun at different wavelengths and spatial scales. This data results in solar physicists 
having to download and process gigabytes of data; for example NASA's SDO satellite downloads over 1TB 
of data per day. This influx of data comes in many forms; the most common solar data type is that of images. 
However, there are many other types of regularly collected data types, such as 1D lightcurves or spectra of 
the whole Sun or parts of it. It is clear therefore that solar physicists require access to the tools to 
process and analyse large quantities of data at different times, wavelengths and spatial scales.

Currently most solar physics is currently performed with a library of IDL routines called solarsoft,
while this library of software is freely avalible the IDL program itself is not. One of SunPy's key aims
is to provide a free and open source alternative to the solarsoft library.

The scope of a solar physics library can be divided up into two main parts, data analysis and data processing.
Data analysis is the scientific analysis of calibrated aligned data where as data processing is the process 
of calibrating and aliging the data. SunPy's current scope is data analysis with minimal data processing.
