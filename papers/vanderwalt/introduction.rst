Introduction
------------

Welcome to the third publication of the SciPy conference proceedings.  This
year marked the 10th Python in Science conference (SciPy2011), which was held
in Austin, Texas from July 11th to 16th.  The conference was attended by **XX**
participants from both academia and industry.  Attendees came from far and
wide, including North America, **XX**


Conference
----------

**XX**

Proceedings
-----------

Each of the **XX** submitted abstracts was reviewed by both the program chairs
and two additional members of the program committee. The committee consisted of
**XX** members from **XX** countries, and represented both industry and academia.

Abstracts were evaluated according to the following criteria:
applicability, novelty, and general impression.

We accepted **XX** submissions for oral presentation at the conference. At the end
of the conference, we invited the presenters to submit their work for
publication in the proceedings. These submissions were reviewed by **XX**
proceedings reviewers from **XX** countries.  Each reviewer provided an overall
score for each reviewed paper, based on the quality of approach and writing.
Reviewers were also asked to provide more specific feedback according to the
questionnaire shown in the appendix.

Acknowledgements
----------------

A conference the size of SciPy is only possible through the hard work and
dedication of a large number of volunteers.  Once again Enthought
provided significant administrative support.

We thank sponsors 

These proceedings are the result of many hours of work by authors and reviewers
alike.  We thank them for their significant investment in these manuscripts.
The names of all contributers are listed in the "Organization" section, which
forms part of the cover material.

Appendix: Reviewer Questionnaire
--------------------------------

- Is the code made publicly available and does the article sufficiently
  describe how to access it?  We aim not to publish papers that essentially
  advertise propetiary software.  Therefore, if the code is not publicly
  available, please provide a one- to two- sentence response to each of the
  following questions:

  - Does the article focus on a topic other than the features
    of the software itself?
  - Can the majority of statements made be externally validated
    (i.e., without the use of the software)?
  - Is the information presented of interest to readers other than
    those at whom the software is aimed?
  - Is there any other aspect of the article that would
    justify including it despite the fact that the code
    isn't available?
  - Does the article discuss the reasons the software is closed?

- Does the article present the problem in an appropriate context?
  Specifically, does it:

  - explain why the problem is important,
  - describe in which situations it arises,
  - outline relevant previous work,
  - provide background information for non-experts

- Is the content of the paper accessible to a computational scientist
  with no specific knowledge in the given field?

- Does the paper describe a well-formulated scientific or technical
  achievement?

- Are the technical and scientific decisions well-motivated and
  clearly explained?

- Are the code examples (if any) sound, clear, and well-written?

- Is the paper factually correct?

- Is the language and grammar of sufficient quality?

- Are the conclusions justified?

- Is prior work properly and fully cited?

- Should any part of the article be shortened or expanded?

- In your view, is the paper fit for publication in the conference proceedings?
  Please suggest specific improvements and indicate whether you think the
  article needs a significant rewrite (rather than a minor revision).
