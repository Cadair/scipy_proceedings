Crab: A Recommendation Engine Framework for Python
--------------------------------------------------


.. class:: abstract

	Crab is a flexible, fast recommender engine for Python that integrates classic information filtering
	recommendation algorithms in the world of scientific Python packages (NumPy,SciPy, Matplotlib).The engine 
	aims to provide a rich set of components from which you can construct a customized recommender system from 
	a set of algorithms. It is designed for scability, flexibility and performance making use of scientific 
	optimized python packages in order to provide simple and efficient solutions that are acessible to everybody
	and reusable in various contexts: science and engineering.
	The engine takes users' preferences for items and returns estimated preferences for other items. For instance,
	a web site that sells movies could easily use Crab to figure out, from past purchase data, which movies a
	customer might be interested in watching to. This work presents our inniative in developing this framework
	in Python following the standards of the well-known machine learning toolkit Scikit-Learn to be an alternative
	solution for Mahout Taste collaborative framework for Java. Finally, we will present its main features,
	real scenarios where this framework is already applied and future extensions.

Introduction
------------
With the great advancements of machine learning in the past few years, many new learning algorithms have been
proposed and one of the most recognizable techniques in use today are the recommender engines. There are several
services or sites that attempt to recommend books or movies or articles based on users past actions. By trying to
infer tastes and preferences, those systems focus to identify unknown items that are are of interest.
