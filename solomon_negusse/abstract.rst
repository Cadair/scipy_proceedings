Simulation models of estuaries require a large effort, broadly divided into the
various stages of data assembly, model setup, multiple simulation runs, post 
processing and analysis of results. Traditionally, many of these stages have 
required expensive commercial software. Frustration with the limitations of 
black box software and expensive licenses led to an exploration of 
alternatives. Now, two years later, Python is the glue that holds the whole
together. Data assembly is aided by the python packages developed in-house for
retrieval and QA/QC of data. Model setup and simulation runs use a combination 
of commercial software, open source Fortran code and python scripts. 
Numpy/Scipy have replaced Matlab for post processing and analysis and 2D and 3D
visualization is being done with Matplotlib, Mayavi and Tecplot.

We discuss how these open source tools and techniques have improved efficiency,
reproducability and acted as enablers for new capabilities. We map our 
transition from stand alone scripts to Python packages that are now being 
released on Github under the swtools organization.
